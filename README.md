#horiseon-accessibility

I worked on the accessibility for Horiseon's webpage. 

I was able to:

> add alt attributes to all images 
> ensure chosing from the menu on the top of the web page to get to the section
> condensed CSS elements for benefits and content sections
> gave footer the correct html tag
> broke up div tags with some section tags wrapped around
